I have been out of work for over three years now. I get it, age and academics have a profound impact the later your life happens.
This is a project that demonstrates my tenacity to be in a team of programmers, to learn from those in the profession. This is a project that says "I need work".
Please look over this initial release, which is more UI at the moment. If you like what you see and want someone who is dedicated, please contact me.
Contained in the directory is a readme.txt file containing preliminary specs of the application I am working on.
