My journey began back in 1984 when desktop computers were sold on corner computer stores. Remember 386 and 486? Yes, memories are great!

This project is mainly for employer's to understand why I like to program and provides a sample of my skills (as they are at the writing of this application).

The application is an ASP.Net Core MVC application designed for a fictitious tool shop called Precision Tooling. The EF behind it indicates I'm using Entity Framework. Not out of need or desire because I'd rather be working with ADO.Net as that is the technology I am accustom to.

It appears more and more companies are working with EF than bare metal.


Precision Tooling EF
--------------------
So, the fictitious tool shop has a desire to create/upgrade their existing workflow and have a better way to collect cost information for jobs. 

Precision Tooling desires a way to capture client information. A client can either be another business or a walk-in for something small (small engine repair, work that requires the use of tooling machines).

There will be two ways to create a job for the client. Precision Tooling can provide the client with a proposal which once accepted by the client can be turned into a job. Or, a Precision Tooling employee can simply create a job and create a new customer.

Once a job is created, labor and materials will be created by the engineer and/or an office administrator.

When the application opens they would like a Reports landing page that contains cost analysis for all open Precision Tooling jobs with the ability to hover over a job and see analysis information - Labor, Material, Miscellaneous. 
The exact layout is to be determined.

For Labor, they want to keep up with general information regarding the employee and general payroll information. A general user can enter this information...at this point. Security will be determined.

I realize there could be more, however this is a sample app to assist me in my endeavor to be hired on and work with a team of developers to hone my skills.  At QSolutions, under HWA, I was the only programmer and the technology at the time was ASP Classic, Visual Basic 6, VBScript, HTML, Javascript, JQuery. They were using the latest SQL Server.  I developed scripts, both SQL and SSIS within Visual Studio 2017/19/22.
